    "This exercise is based on section 5.1 in *Speech and Language Processing* by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. We will implement the model and required functions stept by step, but if you are intereseted in reading about it in one go with more explanations you can do so in the file `chapter5.pdf`.\n",

    "We frame spelling correction as a classification problem and use Bayesian inference to obtain results. Although the\n",

    "\n",
    "Given an observation $x$ and a corpus of words $W$. For spelling correction, we want to find the most likely correction $w\\in W$ for $x$.\n",

    "## Language Model\n",
    "The probability $p(w)$ is also called **language model**, since it represents our model of how words are distributed.\n",
    "There are multiple classes of language models. \n",
    "The simplest class of model is the unigram model, where the probability of each word is fixed and can be obtained by using the frequency of its occurrence in a given corpus.\n",
    "Within the directory `books` you will find several `.txt` files that contain (parts) of books from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). This source shall provide the basis for obtaining the corpus $W$ and for training a language model.\n",

    "### Task 1 (2 Points)\n",
    "Load the book texts from the `.txt` files, filter the alphabetic\n",
    "expressions and calculate the frequencies of occurrences of the existing words.\n",
    "What are the top 10 most occuring words, how often to they occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to store $W$ in a data structure, where you can quickly check if $w\\in W$ for a word $w$ (see [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- the files are encoded in utf-8\n",
    "- use [regex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to filter for words\n",
    "- lower case the words\n",
